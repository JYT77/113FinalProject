            <h4><p>Portraits of Vincent van Gogh</p></h4>
            <p>The portraits of Vincent van Gogh (1853~1890) include self-portraits, portraits of him by other artists, and photographs—one of which is dubious—of the Dutch artist. </p>

            <h4><p>Sunflowers</p></h4>
            <p>Van Gogh's paintings of Sunflowers are among his most famous. He did them in Arles, in the south of France, in 1888 and 1889. Vincent painted a total of five large canvases with sunflowers in a vase, with three shades of yellow "and nothing else". </p>

            <h4><p>Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette</p></h4>
            <p>Van Gogh painted it in early 1886, while studying at the art academy in Antwerp. The painting shows that he had a good command of anatomy. Drawing skeletons was a standard exercise at the academy, but painting them was not part of the curriculum. </p>
